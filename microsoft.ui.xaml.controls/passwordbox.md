PasswordBox lets a user enter a masked password.

<img alt="Password box control" src="images/controls/PasswordBox.png" />

The user can enter a single line of non-wrapping text in a PasswordBox control. The text is not displayed while it is entered; only password characters that mask the text are displayed. You can specify this password character by setting the [PasswordChar](passwordbox_passwordchar.md) property.

Use the [Password](passwordbox_password.md) property to get or set the content of the PasswordBox. Handle the [PasswordChanged](passwordbox_passwordchanged.md) event to get the [Password](passwordbox_password.md) value while the user enters it.

For more info, see [PasswordBox control guide](/windows/apps/design/controls/password-box).

### Password reveal mode

The [PasswordRevealMode](passwordbox_passwordrevealmode.md) property lets you customize the password viewing experience. By default, the PasswordBox has a built-in button that the user can press to display the password text. When the user releases it, the password is automatically hidden again. Note that due to security reasons that button is shown only when the PasswordBox receives focus for the first time and a character is entered. If the PasswordBox loses focus and then regains focus, the button is not shown again unless the password is cleared and character entry starts over.

Windows 10, version 1607, introduces a new keyboard shortcut for accessibility. When the focus is in the PasswordBox and the password reveal button is visible, the user can press and hold Alt+F8 to reveal their password. When they let go of either key press, the password is hidden again.

You can hide the password reveal button, or provide a custom UI to let the user reveal the password. For more info and examples, see [PasswordRevealMode](passwordbox_passwordrevealmode.md) and [PasswordBox control guide](/windows/apps/design/controls/password-box).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [PasswordRevealMode](passwordbox_passwordrevealmode.md) property instead of the [IsPasswordRevealButtonEnabled](passwordbox_ispasswordrevealbuttonenabled.md) property. [IsPasswordRevealButtonEnabled](passwordbox_ispasswordrevealbuttonenabled.md) is deprecated in Windows 10 and any value is ignored.

### Control style and template

You can modify the default [Style](../microsoft.ui.xaml/style.md) and [ControlTemplate](controltemplate.md) to give the control a unique appearance. For information about modifying a control's style and template, see [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles). The default style, template, and resources that define the look of the control are included in the `generic.xaml` file. For design purposes, `generic.xaml` is installed with the Windows App SDK NuGet package. By default, this location is `\Users\<username>\.nuget\packages\microsoft.windowsappsdk\<version>\lib\uap10.0\Microsoft.UI\Themes\generic.xaml`. Styles and resources from different versions of the SDK might have different values.

XAML also includes resources that you can use to modify the colors of a control in different visual states without modifying the control template. Modifying these resources is preferred to setting properties such as [Background](control_background.md) and [Foreground](control_foreground.md). For more info, see the [Light-weight styling](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles#lightweight-styling) section of the [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles) article.

Resources that start with `TextControl` are shared by [TextBox](textbox.md), `PasswordBox`, [RichEditBox](richeditbox.md), and [AutoSuggestBox](autosuggestbox.md). Changes to these resources will affect all four controls.

This example shows a PasswordBox control that demonstrates the [Password](passwordbox_password.md) property and the [PasswordChanged](passwordbox_passwordchanged.md) event. When the user enters text into this PasswordBox, it's checked to see if it's the literal value, "Password". If it is, a message is displayed to the user.

```xaml
<PasswordBox x:Name="passwordBox" Width="200" MaxLength="16"
             PasswordChanged="passwordBox_PasswordChanged"/>
           
<TextBlock x:Name="statusText" Margin="10" HorizontalAlignment="Center"/>
```

```csharp

private void passwordBox_PasswordChanged(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (passwordBox.Password == "Password")
    {
        statusText.Text = "'Password' is not allowed as a password.";
    }
    else
    {
        statusText.Text = string.Empty;
    }
}
```
