# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.BitmapIconSource

## -description

Represents an icon source that uses a bitmap as its content.

## -remarks

**BitmapIconSource** is similar to [BitmapIcon](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.bitmapicon). However, because it is not a [FrameworkElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.frameworkelement), it can be shared.
