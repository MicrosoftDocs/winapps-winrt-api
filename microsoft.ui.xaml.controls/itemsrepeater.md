# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ItemsRepeater

<!--
public class ItemsRepeater : Windows.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement
-->

## -description

Represents a data-driven collection control that incorporates a flexible layout system, custom views, and virtualization, with no default UI or interaction policies.

## -remarks

While an ItemsRepeater can be used to present a basic set of items, it is typically just a building block for your own unique collection-based experiences, and is most often used as the display element in the template of a custom control.

ItemsRepeater supports virtualization when attached to a host that supports virtualization.
