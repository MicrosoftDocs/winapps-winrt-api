# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.PathIconSource

## -description

Represents an icon source that uses a vector path as its content.

## -remarks

**PathIconSource** is similar to [PathIcon](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pathicon). However, because it is not a [FrameworkElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.frameworkelement), it can be shared.
