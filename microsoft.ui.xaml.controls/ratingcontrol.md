## -remarks

### Control style and template

You can modify the default [Style](../microsoft.ui.xaml/style.md) and [ControlTemplate](controltemplate.md) to give the control a unique appearance. For information about modifying a control's style and template, see [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles). The default style, template, and resources that define the look of the control are included in the `generic.xaml` file. For design purposes, `generic.xaml` is installed with the Windows App SDK NuGet package. By default, this location is `\Users\<username>\.nuget\packages\microsoft.windowsappsdk\<version>\lib\uap10.0\Microsoft.UI\Themes\generic.xaml`. Styles and resources from different versions of the SDK might have different values.

XAML also includes resources that you can use to modify the colors of a control in different visual states without modifying the control template. Modifying these resources is preferred to setting properties such as [Background](control_background.md) and [Foreground](control_foreground.md). For more info, see the [Light-weight styling](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles#lightweight-styling) section of the [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles) article.
