## -examples

This example shows how to use the Line class to create three lines.

```xaml
<Canvas Height="300" Width="300">
  <!- - Draws a diagonal line from (10,10) to (50,50). - ->
  <Line
    X1="10" Y1="10"
    X2="50" Y2="50"
    Stroke="Black"
    StrokeThickness="4" />

  <!- - Draws a diagonal line from (10,10) to (50,50)
       and moves it 100 pixels to the right. - ->
  <Line
    X1="10" Y1="10"
    X2="50" Y2="50"
    Stroke="Blue"
    StrokeThickness="4"
    Canvas.Left="100"/>

  <!- - Draws a horizontal line from (10,60) to (150,60). - ->
  <Line
     X1="10" Y1="60"
     X2="150" Y2="60"
     Stroke="Black"
     StrokeThickness="4"/>

</Canvas>
