# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Shapes.Ellipse

## -description
Draws an ellipse with a given [Height](../microsoft.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_height.md) and [Width](../microsoft.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_width.md) specified in device-independent pixel (DIP).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<EllipseÂ .../>
```

## -remarks

You can set the [Fill](shape_fill.md) property to give the shape a background fill, like a solid color, gradient, or image. You can set the [Stroke](shape_stroke.md) and other related stroke properties to specify the look of the shape's outline.

## -examples

This example shows how to create an Ellipse in XAML and set some of its common properties as attribute values.

```xaml
    <StackPanel>
        <Ellipse
         Fill="Yellow"
         Height="100"
         Width="200"
         StrokeThickness="2"
         Stroke="Black"/>
    </StackPanel>
```
