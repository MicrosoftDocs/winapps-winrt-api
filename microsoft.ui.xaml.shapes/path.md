# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Shapes.Path

## -description
Draws a series of connected lines and curves. The line and curve dimensions are declared through the [Data](path_data.md) property, and can be specified either with [Move and draw commands syntax](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/move-draw-commands-syntax), or with an object model.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<PathÂ .../>
```

## -remarks

## -examples

This XAML example uses a **Path** with a [GeometryGroup](../microsoft.ui.xaml.media/geometrygroup.md) value as [Data](path_data.md) to draw a superimposed ellipse and rectangle shape.

```xaml
<Canvas> 
  <Path Fill="Gold" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1">
    <Path.Data>
      <GeometryGroup>
        <EllipseGeometry Center="50,50" RadiusX="50" RadiusY="50"/>
        <RectangleGeometry Rect="0,0,100,100" />
      </GeometryGroup>
    </Path.Data>
  </Path> 
</Canvas>
```
