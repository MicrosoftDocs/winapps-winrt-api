# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.DependencyObject.GetAnimationBaseValue

## -description

Returns any base value established for a dependency property, which would apply in cases where an animation is not active.

## -parameters

### -param dp

The identifier for the desired dependency property.

## -returns

The returned base value.

## -remarks

Use `GetAnimationBaseValue` to get values that might currently be animated but you want to know the value before the animation ran. Note that animations with **HoldEnd** behavior might not have this same value. For more info on the **HoldEnd** concept, see [Storyboarded animations](/windows/apps/design/motion/storyboarded-animations).

Animations that are used for visual states don't have **HoldEnd** behavior but do apply an animated value applied while the state is active.
