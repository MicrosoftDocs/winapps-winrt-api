# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.SizeHelper

## -description

Provides helper methods to evaluate or set [Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size) values. C# code should use members of [Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size) instead.

## -remarks

[Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size) is a Windows Runtime structure that represents a rectangle's dimensions without an origin.

SizeHelper is one of several **Helper** classes that are intended to provide utility methods for Windows Runtime structure values. C# code can use members of [Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size) instead, because utility members are available directly on the structure due to .NET runtime support. C++ code can only access the data values on [Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size), for example `Height`. For C++ developers, approximately the same utility features that a C# developer could use directly on [Size](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.size) are available in a static form on the `SizeHelper` class.
